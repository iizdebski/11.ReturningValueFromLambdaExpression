Returning a Value From a Lambda Expression

You can return values from Java Lambda Expressions, just like you
can from a method. You just add a return statement to the lambda
function body, like this:

(param)-> System.out.printIn("param:" + param);
return "return value";
}

What all your lambda expressions are doing is to calculate a return
value and return it, you can specify the return value in a shorter way.
Instead of this:
(a1, a2)->{return a1>a2;}
You can write:
(a1, a2)->a1>a2;
The compiler then figures out that the expression a1>a2 is the
return value of the lambda expression (hence the name
lambda expressions - as expressions return a value of some kind).
